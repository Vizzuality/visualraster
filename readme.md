Visual raster tests
===================

This repo contains some examples of per pixel image processing using HTML5 canvas element and some javascript code. There are 3 examples:

 - flood_fill.html: shows how to use [flood fill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill) technique.
 - contour_tracing.html: search contour for shapes with the same color. Clicking on the image the contour of the selected color is highlight.
 - threshold.html: filter image based on a threshold changed by user. In this example an altitude map is shown and can be filtered using a slider.


In order to run examples you should put files in a public folder of your http server. This is because security issues with cross domain images using canvas element:

``` bash
$ git clone git://github.com/Vizzuality/visualraster.git
$ cd test_pixel
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
$ open http://localhost:8000 (on osx)
```

If you want to run the maps_threshold example locally, you will need to
run a small proxy server to bypass the CANVAS tag cross domain policy in order to load remote tiles.

Install node.js and run the proxy.js like so:

``` bash
$ git clone git://github.com/Vizzuality/visualraster.git
$ cd test_pixel
$ node proxy.js
$ open http://localhost:8080/maps_threshold.html (on osx)
```
